Naming Scheme - This needs to be obeyed in order for the program to pick up certain kinds of files.

Histograms - Format is yyyymmddZ where Z is the stand-in for the section/zone letter -must- be capitalised

Dimensions for cropping - Bar files are .xml and need to be Z_#_bar where Z is the stand-in for the section/zone letter 
			-must- be capitalised and x is the week number. Pallet files are text Z_#_# with the second number
 			the number of the pallet in the section. Note that the bar files are for the whole section.

Source Folders - If you are using an alternative source folder for any program past 'ply. to .bin' you need to have 
		a sub folder called "Default" or "Smart error" where error is the registration error used during the smart
		cropping.

Registration Error Folder - Must contain subfolders entitled "z_shift" and "no_z_shift"
