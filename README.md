# Hydralab-Pallet-Comparison

This is a Python GUI to automate the process of generating contours for a set of point clouds. 

# Notes on naming
The GUI will create a folder called "Comparison Output" when it is run for the first time, this is where the input and output files are kept, with the exception of the parameter files stored in the "parameter_files" folder. 

Make sure that the parameter files have correct spacing - one line per input
